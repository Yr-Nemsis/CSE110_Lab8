# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I choose the first choice -- Within a Github Action that runs whenever code is pushed. 
Because automated code review can provide simple indication of hot spots in a code base looking for large functions or classes, too much call or parameter complexity and other heurisitics. Also, local tests should be performed manually instead of automatedly and automated tests such as unit tests should be performed before the start of the test of running all the code in an once. 
2. No, because such should be dealt with unit testing which is much faster and isolated. 
3. No, because Unit tests should be used to test on small-sacale features such as if the return value of a function is correct or more specific functionality.
4. Yes because we are bascially checking if the uses of a "if" statement is executed correctly, which is small-scale and specific.
